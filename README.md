## Installation

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Copy and edit `.env.example`

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

Export environment variables and use `setup.sh` to create `database.ini`

```bash
source .env
bash setup.sh
```

If you want to start a local development instance, use `docker-compose.dev.yml`.

```bash
docker-compose --file docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

## Usage

Start Omeka S

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

If your installation complains about not being able to write to the folder `files`, fix permissions accordingly.

```bash
chown -R www-data:www-data files logs modules themes
```

Stop Omeka S

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Install [EasyInstall](https://github.com/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-EasyInstall) to make your life more easy

```bash
cd modules
curl -L -o EasyInstall-3.2.5.zip "https://github.com/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-EasyInstall/releases/download/3.2.5/EasyInstall-3.2.5.zip"
